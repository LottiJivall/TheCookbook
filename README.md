# The Cosmic Cookbook

A collection of the best recipes in the universe as interpreted by the best chefs of the Milky Way.

This git repository serves as the working platform for collecting the best recipes.
The cookbook is written in LaTex and needs to be compiled for the best reading experience

# Compiling the cookbook

A working installation of `pdflatex` is needed. We suggest installing the [MikTeX distribution](https://miktex.org/).

With the above dependency satisfied compilation is as simple as:

```
pdflatex cookbook.tex
```
